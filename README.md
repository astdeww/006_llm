# Large Language Model (LLM)

LLM is a type of artificial intelligence that's trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. To start learning about LLMs, it's helpful to understand the basics of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning. Here's a suggested path:
1. **Basics of Python**: Since many NLP libraries are in Python, having a good grasp of Python basics is essential.
2. **Introduction to NLP**: Learn about tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and other fundamental NLP concepts.
3. **Machine Learning**: Understand the principles of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as LLMs use these techniques.
4. **Deep Learning**: Dive into deep learning concepts, such as neural networks, backpropagation, and optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
5. **NLP Libraries**: Familiarize yourself with popular NLP libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face's Transformers.
6. **Pre-trained Models**: Learn about pre-trained LLMs like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models and their applications.
7. **Fine-tuning**: Understand how to fine-tune pre-trained models on specific tasks or domains.
